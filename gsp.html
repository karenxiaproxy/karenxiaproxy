  The Argentine Tango - Performed in Buenos Aires
  </h2>
    <p>
      The historical background on the tango and samba continually inform interpretations of their live performances today.  The following six clips, all part of two live performances recorded in 2017, provide small but deliberate windows into the souls of these two iconic musical and dance styles. 
  The following five video clips are all from the same live tango music and dance performance at “Complejo Tango” in the Balvanera neighborhood in Buenos Aires.
As a whole, this performance was not simply a pure tango performance.  There were pieces in this performance that could arguably be categorized as completely different musical styles – but all of these styles were cornerstones of the historical elements that led to the creation of the tango in its own right.  
The musical accompaniment to a tango may consist of one, two, or a small group of instrumentalists, each with an instrument that plays a crucial role in shaping the holistic sound and feel of a tango. This orquesta típica—literally, “typical orchestra”—complements every live tango dance performance.  At its simplest, there will be one or two guitars.  In a more expanded orquesta, there is generally a combination of string, woodwind, and concertina instruments. In this particular live performance, there is one violin, one accordion-like instrument called a bandoneón, a keyboard—substituting for a full grand or standing piano, and a double bass.  Often a flute will also be included in this ensemble of instruments.  “Complejo Tango” places the focus of the audience on the dance, specifically.  The tango musicians play the live music from a balcony above stage left, which evidently removes them from the focal point of attention.  However, the music of the tango is arguably its most essential quality – as without the music, the dance does not fully animate. 
The “Complejo Tango” performance was organized to allow the audience to experience distinct characteristics of the tango – particularly in its musical style.

      Video 1. Argentine tango show (part 1) in Balvanera, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 8 June 2017. 
    </p>

      This first video highlights the upbeat and fast-tempo nature of the tango.  Even though this clip is very short, it shows how vital both the violin and double bass are to keeping the rushed feeling of the music alive.  They work in tandem, yet against each other.  The violin pushes the tempo forward, as if hitting the accelerator on the piece.  The occasional slight screeching sound that emits from the point at which violin bow hits string evinces the force applied by the violinist.  At the same time, the bass, although much softer in dynamics than the violin, keeps a steady pulse throughout the piece.  The bass’ short, plucked-string staccato notes from the beginning to 0:11, followed by smooth, connected notes for the last seven seconds of the clip preempt the violin’s tendency to surge forward.  Contrary to its role in this beginning of this clip, the violin actually leads the ensemble in slowing the tempo slightly near the tail end of the clip, at 0:16, in preparation for an even faster, heart-racing tempo to end the piece.  Further, the dancers mimic the stress of the violin part through their quick and swinging footwork.  This clip represents the lively fervor that first defined the tango when it was introduced to the world.

      This video clip displays the end of a dance number and accompanying musical piece.  Compared to the first clip, it is apparent that the tempo is slower, and more controlled. 
Half way through the clip, at the 0:13 mark, the key changes from major to minor, and also switches from a brighter theme to the mischievous main theme of the whole performance.  This change in key and pace of the piece – the main theme is a motif to which the tango will always return.

      This clip showcases the versatility of the tango dance steps to adjust to the mood of the music at hand.  The triple meter in this clip is reminiscent of the German Waltz, which is one of the lesser-known influences of the tango.  The waltz had experienced its fair share of starlight in the early to mid-nineteenth century, just before the tango made a name for itself.  By isolating just the music, one can imagine a couple dancing the classic three-step waltz.  Yet, as shown in this video, the tango embellishes the classic waltz with its signature foot sweeps and quicksteps. 
The ease in which the members of the orquesta típica are able to mold their instrumental tones into one that suits a happy-go-lucky tune speaks to the role each of them holds in the ensemble.  In this piece, the bandoneon is featured, leading the orquesta by drawing out the soothing, imperfect timbre of vibrating reeds within this concertina. 
The tango rhythm, in its simplest form, is heard in the music of this video clip.  The beginning of the clip, until 0:41, indicates a gradual transition to this pure tango rhythm.  From the beginning of the clip until 0:24, the couple dances to a quadruple-meter minor-key piece, and uses the fifteen-second switch from major to minor key to slide into the recognizable tango rhythm.  Its duple or quadruple meter primarily characterizes the tango rhythm, where the emphasis falls on first and/or third beats of a four-beat group of musical notes.  The unique aspect of the tango lies in the very last half beat of a four-beat group of notes: it surprises listeners with an accent, creating syncopated rhythm.  In this clip, this accented half-beat occurs every time the bandoneon begins to hold a sudden, loud and long sustained note.

      In the tango, the double bass or piano would take on the role of the “time-keeper.”  However, the Brazilian samba, unlike the tango, relies heavily on percussion to help keep the beat and move a song forward.  The percussion instrument usually manifests itself in the form of a drum, often a tamborim.  Similar to the tango, the samba also utilizes syncopated rhythms on duple or quadruple meter, which surprises listeners’ ears and empowers musicians to be more playful in their craft of placing an offbeat.

      The singer in video clip 5, instead, capitalizes on audience participation and performs his song through a mixture of singing and speaking.  He deftly becomes more intimate with the audience through this back-and-forth exchange of words.

      Video 6. Samba show (part 2) in Praça Tiradentes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 19 May 2017. 
    </p>
    <p>
     In video clip 6, the drums sound more distinguishable than in video clip 5.  It may be due to the replacement of one drum—the second from the left of the lead singer—with a cowbell-like instrument.  The isolation of this harsh bell sound, among the softer guitars and background drum beats serves to emphasize the melancholic voice of the singer.  It almost seems to evoke an emotional outpouring of saudade, the Portuguese word for a state of yearning, nostalgia, and melancholy wrapped up in one feeling.  He distances himself from the audience, not intentionally, but the hurt in his voice, especially apparent from 00:54 to 00:57, solicits feelings of sympathy, but not necessarily empathy.

      Through these video clips, the tango and samba have revealed their unique personalities and musical identifiers.  Although the tango show in Buenos Aires had a more dance-oriented philosophy, its placement of musicians off-center did not permit the most favorable audience experience, as the music only came in uneven bouts from one side of the room.  On the other hand, the samba show surrounded audience members with music by employing a circular organization structure conducive to acoustics.  At the same time, however, the circle is also completely closed off to new members – connoting an aura of exclusivity. Despite their individual intentions and goals for the performance, throughout these video clips, it is apparent that the instruments’ sounds mingle in the same way that the pairs of dancers and musicians complement each other in their nonverbal communication. 
Both the tango and samba have long foundational histories, from sharing the nexus of the Afro-American slave trade to allowing the incorporation of many cultures and tendrils of other musical styles to shape their current form.  Their syncopated rhythms intercept even the untrained ear, and their melodies, whether blissful or sorrowful, continue to touch our hearts.
