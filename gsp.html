      Not Your Typical Hollywood Musical Style: 
A Spatio-Historical and Musical Critical Analysis of the Argentine Tango and Brazilian Samba
A trip to Latin America cannot be complete without song and dance; they are enmeshed in the collective culture of the continent and ingrained in the souls of the inhabitants.  The terms describing both a musical genre and dancing style are often synonymous with the countries themselves – the tango is Argentinian; the samba belongs to Brazil.  Yet this interchangeability of names is also generalizing and presumptuous.  It begs the questions, to whom does the tango and samba refer to when one conjures up an image of an “Argentine” or “Brazilian” engaging in their respective musical traditions?  Do people often think of one particular archetype of a person, and why?  
Anyone can learn and appreciate the intricacies of a particular kind of music and dance, but their origins may be even more elucidative and crucial than training muscles to remember the musical notes and dance steps associated with them.  Having the background and historical knowledge to inform present actions is the only failsafe way to truly understand.  
	Beginning chronologically, the tango outdates the samba in electronically scanned books by approximately three-quarters of a century.  The tango was known, understood (at least partially) and popularized in the Americas and Europe during the 1910s, which was approximately fifteen years before the samba was referenced in print (“Google Books Ngram Viewer”).  It does not relate to the “founding” of either genre, if there is such a date. 
	According to Google Books’ Ngram Viewer, which counts and temporally maps the relative frequency of a word or phrase in Google’s corpus of electronically scanned books, the word “tango” first appears in an advertisement for “New Music” in The Illustrated London News in 1850.  The performance show was titled, “El tango, Havanero, and Lamentacion de los Negros,” costing 2 shillings for each attendee.  The performance did not seem to be the best-selling or attractive one, as it was not listed first, and cost less than half of a purportedly more popular performance of two ballads by composer and verse-writer George Linley, which cost more than double the “tango” performance: 5 shillings each (New Music 356).  Although this source to the ‘tango’ does not reference Argentina specifically, it does refer to both “Havanero,” and “Negros,” which ostensibly recognize both the Cuban—Habanera—and African influence on this music tradition. 
In the United States, even though Google Ngram Viewer indicates that the first appearance of “Argentine tango” was in 1853, the real establishment of popularity began in 1910, through the decade and into the roaring twenties, where new genres of song and dance were popping up left and right.  A tango performance was reviewed for the first time in The New York Times on November 1, 1917 (“The New York Times Theater Reviews”), and between 1912 and 1914, “the Argentine Tango and the Brazilian Maxixe, were so universally danced, notwithstanding their doubtful character, that they incurred the serious displeasure and the condemnation of many churches and respectable people” (Colby & Sandeman 539B).  The tango’s rise in notoriety coincided with that of many dances bearing animal-related monikers, such as the “Turkey Trot,” “Bunny Hug,” and “Grizzly Bear,” whose infectious dance steps spread throughout the continental U.S. and Europe.  As these kinds of dances and accompanying music were not proper or conservative in a way that was conformant to the standard of the time, the dancing societies of both continents were forced to alter and adapt steps to make them more widely accepted, especially by the Church.
The worldwide popularity of the tango began in 1910, but its origin stories pre-date the Great World War by at least a century, to when the first African slaves were auctioned and sold in the large port cities along the Rio de la Plata: Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay.  These slaves were either sent directly from Western and Sub-Saharan Africa, or oftentimes, from the geographically closer slave trading hotbeds of Brazil (Edwards).  When slaves were transported en masse to the Rio de la Plata, most of them ended up being publically sold in Buenos Aires, the largest Latin American city at the fin de siècle, specifically in Lezama Park, in the southern part of the modern-day Monserrat district – right by the ports (Cottrol 144).  Aside from those that had been bought and assigned to live with their masters in the inner neighborhoods, the slave population of Buenos Aires brought their customs and traditions to the San Telmo neighborhood (Cottrol 156). 
Two major groups of people are thought to have influenced the development of the tango, as the world knows it today.  The first were the slaves of Rio de la Plata, unevenly distributed between Montevideo and the more monumental city of Buenos Aires.  The “candombe,” a type of music and dance based on the combination of different drums and their beats, was often performed in the public spaces of San Telmo, among the slave community for pleasure, as well as important events such as funerals (Juzefovič 53).  The characteristic offbeat rhythms greatly influenced the foundational rhythms of the tango. 
The second major influence to the tango’s rhythm was more contemporary to the time in which the tango became famous, both locally and globally.  Black sailors from Cuba, who immigrated to Rio de la Plata at the end of the nineteenth century, brought the Western-European-inspired Habanera style of music and dance over from their Caribbean island.  The syncopated rhythms of Habanera, or “Tango Americano,” as it was called in Argentina, directly carried over to the beloved Milonga genre of music in Buenos Aires circa 1870 (Juzefovič 53). Milonga was the last stage in the metamorphosis of music and beats into the Argentine tango.  
Yet it is disputed whether or not African slaves, who brought their rhythmic music culture to the Americas really had as influential of a hand in popularizing the tango.  By the 1860s, at least half a century before the tango had swept the world by storm, slavery had already been completely abolished in the entirety of Argentina.  Many blacks had left the historical mass slave port of Buenos Aires, and thus, in a twisted fad-obsession, the porteño demand for blacks led to more coverage in the media and entertainment of blacks, or rather, those who resembled them – naturally or unnaturally.  Blackface became pervasive at public celebrations such as Carnaval.  One school of thought argues that the increasing preeminence of the tango in the Rio de la Plata region and the world stage was more of a Afro-fetish of sorts by European immigrants and already-established Argentines of European descent.  They were fascinated by blacks “as something romantic, exotic and tragic” (Juzefovič 53).  
The tango became a fashionable style of music and dance before and during World War I, whereas the samba was a World War II affair.  The samba was first mentioned in English text around 1935, and before 2002, written popularity peaked at the end of the Second World War, in 1945.  An exponential rise in text mentions in 1980 revived interest.  Time Magazine in the U.S., first introduces American audiences to the samba in 1942 with the short descriptor: “notable alike for its breezy tempo and lilting bounce” (Luce 1942).   The usage of the words “breezy” and “lilting” in this description immediately invokes a sense of island time, or exotic lands that are not present in wartime, industrialized America.  It appears to lure readers away from the violent actions of the period and jet them off to paradisiacal destinations where nobody worries, or is affected by death and despair.   
The samba musical tradition has been present in a number of provinces and cities throughout Brazil – with one common thread, like the tango: Africans.  The states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and city of São Paulo, all close to the Atlantic Coast, are frequently cited as hosts of the famous samba.  But it is known to have grown out of the blue-collar black and mulatto communities in Rio de Janeiro, a city that is often thought of as Brazil’s center and authority of culture (Galinsky 120).  The largest concentration of Afro-Brazilians were historically in Gamboa, a neighborhood in the northern part of Rio, by the water, where many blacks, both enslaved and freed, lived during both their servitude and following emancipation (Hertzman 701).  Nicknamed “Little Africa,” Gamboa was a stronghold for the continued preservation and development of African culture inside Brazil. 
Around the 1930s, as samba began to gain traction as a musical style, Afro-Brazilian artists thought to capitalize on the growing strength and demand of this market.  But these musicians soon found it difficult to make a living creating and performing their music, even though it was immensely popular on home soil and abroad.  The more samba was linked to a sense of Brazilian nationality – or brasilidade – the harder Afro-Brazilians fought to keep their piece of this brasilidade (Hertzman 701). They were subtly discriminated against in a myriad of ways.  For example, when approaching studios with the intention of producing an official recording of their music, the studios rejected them on the pretense that these self-taught artists did not have the professional training required to put out a full record (Kraay 536). 
The difficulty with which Afro-Brazilians struggled to make ends meet during the first global obsession over the samba in the mid-twentieth century allowed them to reflect and bounce back with “pagoda,” a counterculture movement in the 1970s and 1980s that propelled samba back into the international spotlight after 1980, as well as capture a more ethnically diverse and appreciative audience in Brazil than they had ever have before (Galinsky 120).  The artists of this new age samba made a point of emphasizing the African and mixed-race heritage of themselves and their ancestors – adding a new dimension to how the rest of Brazil and the world interpreted the meanings and supposed equivalence between the samba and brasilidade.
